# Expo Atlas

Inspect your Metro bundle, on module level.

> [!Warning]
> This project is unstable and might not work for your project.

## 🚀 How to use it

Atlas is built into Expo starting from SDK 51, and enabled when defining the environment variable `EXPO_UNSTABLE_ATLAS=true`.

You can use Atlas with two Expo commands:
- `$ expo start` → Start a local dev server, Atlas will listen to any change within your project.
- `$ expo export` → Export your app to Android, iOS, or web. Atlas will generate the `atlas.jsonl` file.

### Using `$ expo start`

When enabling Atlas with the local dev server, you can access Atlas on [http://localhost:8081/_expo/atlas](http://localhost:8081/_expo/atlas). This shows you all information from the bundle loaded during development.

```bash
$ EXPO_UNSTABLE_ATLAS=true npx expo start
```

> [!TIP]
> Expo start runs in development mode by default. If you want to see a production bundle of your app, you can start the local dev server in production mode: `$ expo start --no-dev`.

### Using `$ expo export`

When enabling Atlas during exports, Expo generates the `.expo/atlas.json` file in your project. This file contains all bundle information, including the actual source code of individual files. You can open the Atlas file through `npx expo-atlas [path/to/atlas.jsonl]`.

```bash
# Export the app for all platforms
$ EXPO_UNSTABLE_ATLAS=true npx expo export --platform all

# Open Atlas using the default `.expo/atlas.jsonl` path
$ npx expo-atlas
# Open Atlas from a shared file
$ npx expo-atlas ./path/to/atlas.jsonl
```

## 🏛️ Project structure

- [`apps/example`](./apps/example) — A default Expo project, with Atlas enabled by default
- [`packages/expo-atlas`](./packages/expo-atlas) — The core package of Atlas, including Metro data handling and the CLI command
- [`packages/expo-atlas-ui`](./packages/expo-atlas-ui) — The web-only Expo project representing the UI of Atlas

## 🧑‍💻 Contributing to Atlas

### 🎨 Changing the Atlas UI

If you need to change anything related to the Atlas UI, you need to:

- `$ bun start` — This builds **packages/expo-atlas** and starts **packages/expo-atlas-ui** with a default fixture
- `$ open http://localhost:8081` — To view **packages/expo-atlas-ui**
- Make any change in **packages/expo-atlas-ui**

### 📊 Changing the Atlas data

If you need to change anything related to extracting data from Metro, you need to:

- `$ cd packages/expo-atlas` — Make the changes in **packages/expo-atlas**
- `$ bun start` — Build **packages/expo-atlas** on any change
- Open another terminal
- `$ cd apps/example` — Atlas has a default Expo project to experiment with
- `$ bun start` — The example project automatically enables Atlas through **apps/examples/.env**
  - `$ bun expo export` — The example project can also export an **.expo/atlas.jsonl** file
  - `$ bun expo-atlas` — When exporting an **.expo/atlas.jsonl** file, you can open Atlas using this export

### 📦 Releasing a new version

If you need to release a new version of Atlas, you need to:

- `$ git clean . -xdf && git checkout` — Make sure you have no uncomitted changes
- Update the package version in **packages/expo-atlas/package.json**
- `$ git add . && git commit -m 'chore: release new version `x.x.x`'` — Commit the new version to **main**
- `$ bun install` — Make sure to install all dependencies
- `$ bun run build` — Build both **packages/expo-atlas** and **packages/expo-atlas-ui**
- `$ cd packages/expo-atlas && npm publish` — Release a new version of Atlas
